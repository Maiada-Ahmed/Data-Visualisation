## Survey Design:
The survey was conducted using JISC online, a platform provided by UoL. It was a descriptive study targeting employed and unemployed individuals globally. The survey consisted of 12 close-ended questions divided into three pages. Questions were designed to transition from general to specific questions to achieve a higher response from the respondents.

The survey was distributed randomly among various people with different backgrounds, education, and residence country. However, the sample is restricted to employed and unemployed individuals aged 18 and above. The total number of respondents who completed the survey was 132, along with 21 features before dropping any unnecessary columns.

The survey results have been saved locally in a CSV file and then accessed through the read file command in python (pandas data frame). When the CSV file is imported, a df variable is assigned to the CSV data for future reference. The total number of respondents who completed the survey was 132, along with 21 features
